# Todo List App in React

This project was created as part of Turing Grow upskilling in React. This repo is initially for the front end, built in React and will allow users to add to and edit a todo list. The main aim is to show a good understanding of state management and interactivity. 

## Features for initial app

1. Create an item
2. See all items
3. Delete an item
4. Edit an item
5. Complete an item
6. Edit order (drag items around? Sort by function?)

## Look and feel plans
- Rainbow background
- Card over the top (mobile first look)
- Clean look
- Clouds turning into sunshine animation when you do something?
    - Change card header image of weather according to your completion of todo in %



## Future opportunities

Create and connect to a NodeJS web server, create and connect to a CRUD db web server.
